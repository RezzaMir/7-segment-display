# 7-segment-display
The purpose of this file is to use the Arduino as a decoder for a BCD to 7 segment LED display employing the shift register used previously as the basis for this design as well.  Whereas with the bargraph we were only lighting up one LED at a time, this design will require lighting up more than one LED at a time to configure the digits.
